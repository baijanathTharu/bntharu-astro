# Sample Blog Post: A Guide to Writing Great Code

## Heading 2: The Importance of Code Quality

When it comes to writing code, quality matters. High-quality code is easier to read, maintain, and debug. It can save you time and frustration in the long run. Here are some tips for writing great code:

## List of Tips for Writing Great Code

1. **Use meaningful variable names**: Choose names that clearly describe the purpose of the variable.
2. **Keep functions small**: A function should do one thing and do it well.
3. **Write comments**: Explain why you did something, not just what you did.

## Unordered List of Common Code Smells

- **Magic numbers**: Using numbers directly in your code without explanation.
- **Duplicate code**: Copying and pasting code instead of creating reusable functions.

```js
console.log(
  "This is a sample code snippet to demonstrate how to include code in a blog post.",
);
```

**Bold**, _Italic_, and ~~Strikethrough~~ text can also be used to emphasize important points in your blog post. Remember, the goal is to make your content engaging and easy to read for your audience. Happy coding!
